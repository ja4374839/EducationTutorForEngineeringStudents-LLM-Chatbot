### Introduction
Want to create a chatbot tailored to assist engineering students? Whether you need a tutor to explain complex concepts, provide study resources, or solve technical problems, this guide will walk you through the simple steps to build and deploy your own LLM-based chatbot using Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio—all in just five minutes.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Hugging Face Account:** Required to access the platform where you will build and host your chatbot. [Sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join).

### Setup and Deployment

#### Choosing Your Chatbot’s Identity
Define the specialization of your chatbot. For this project, it will be an educational tutor for engineering students, guiding interactions and capabilities accordingly.

#### Logging into Hugging Face
Log into your Hugging Face account to access the necessary tools for deploying your chatbot. If you don’t have an account, you can create one quickly.

#### Navigating to Hugging Face Spaces
Hugging Face Spaces allows users to create and manage applications easily. Go to [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to get started.

#### Creating Your Space
Create a new space by clicking on 'Create New Space'. Name your Space to reflect the chatbot's role, such as `EngineeringTutor`, for easy identification.

### Configuring Your Chatbot

#### Selecting the Framework and Model
Choose `Gradio` for its user-friendly interface and select a suitable model, like `Zephyr 7B`, which is versatile across various tasks.

#### Customization
Personalize the chatbot by tailoring system messages and interaction styles to fit the selected role. This ensures your chatbot interacts appropriately with users.

### Deployment
